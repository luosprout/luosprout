								<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi, my name is Kevin Luo and I am in grade 12.<br>As an October baby, I'm bound to be:<br><em>Funny, Charismatic, Kind...</em><br>...but also <b>A LATE BLOOMER</b><br>I struggled with my grades and classes in elementary and early highschool. Although a late birthday comes with its benefits, having a later development than most my peers made it difficult to catch up. I couldn't wrap around topics in class like others did. They were stronger, faster, and smarter than I was. I started to believe I wasn't good enough.</p>
									<br>As time went on, I continued growing, but my poor fundamentals continued to hold me back—that is until I watched an Organic Chemistry Tutor video. Videos like his helped me get back on track with school and my learning. They offered a way for me learn all my class material, from very rudementary things, to difficult post-secondary courses.
<br>When I got the chance in my senior year to design a project of my own, I knew almost instantly that this is what I wanted to do. I made it my goal to help others by making similar videos on courses that others struggled with. One of these classes that I put the focus on is Calculus 12. The mid-term average in the class was ~60% and our final was coming up soon. Before and after the final, I recorded some videos explaining and covering topics in the final. Here are some of the responses of my peers to my project.

They were stronger, faster, and smarter than I was. I started to believe I wasn't good enough.</p>

<p>As time went on, I would continue growing, but my poor fundamentals led me to continue down a negative path—that is until I watched an Organic Chemistry Tutor video. Videos like his helped me get back on track with school and my learning. They offered a way for me learn all my class material, from very rudementary things, to difficult post-secondary courses.
